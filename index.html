            <h2>How reliance on AI shapes human connection</h2>
            <div class="meta">By Brennan Shea. November 3, 2025.</div>
            <p>I use artificial intelligence every day. It helps me draft emails, plan tasks, and find patterns in data. These tools feel natural now. Yet as their use expands, I often wonder how this growing reliance changes the way people relate to each other. I argue that AI can lift productivity and widen access, but unchecked dependence can thin real human connection. The goal is not to reject AI but to manage its place responsibly.</p>
            <p>To begin, many people experience clear advantages. AI speeds up routine work by drafting notes, summarizing text, and suggesting ideas. It corrects grammar, organizes schedules, and identifies trends that support healthier choices. Lawson highlights these practical effects in daily communication, showing how AI supports productivity and creativity for ordinary users (Lawson). From my own experience, using AI to streamline tasks frees time for deeper work and more genuine conversations with others.</p>
            <p>Beyond personal benefits, AI creates public value. In Southeast Asia, machine learning helps predict extreme weather, monitor forests, and reduce waste. Board documents these examples and notes that infrastructure challenges remain (Board). These projects show AI as a public good that strengthens safety and sustainability. When tools save lives and protect the environment, they earn their place in society.</p>
            <p>However, these gains come with real costs. The European Parliamentary Research Service warns about surveillance, bias, and privacy loss. When organizations collect more data and automate decisions, unfairness can spread quickly. People who fear misuse may silence themselves, weakening open dialogue (European Parliamentary Research Service). Without careful oversight, the same tools that connect us can also erode trust.</p>
            <p>In addition, excessive reliance on AI can weaken judgment. Students who let chatbots handle every problem lose practice in critical thinking. Managers who delegate feedback to digital assistants risk losing empathy. Russell and Norvig explain that intelligent behavior depends on context, something humans handle better than machines (Russell and Norvig). Delegating thought to AI can slowly reduce the very skills that make us human.</p>
            <p>Some researchers take this concern further. They argue that large language models flood communication channels with fluent but unreliable text. Bender and colleagues call this the stochastic parrots problem. Systems that mimic understanding can amplify bias or distort information (Bender et al.). When confident language masks weak reasoning, it undermines truth and weakens civic trust.</p>
            <p>Similarly, social observers warn about emotional distance. Turkle notes that technology often promises connection while encouraging isolation. People may substitute digital interaction for real dialogue (Turkle). AI could deepen this pattern by handling emotional communication for us. When we let systems draft apologies or condolences, we risk losing authenticity and the chance to practice empathy in real time.</p>
            <p>However, some people may argue that the tools themselves are not the problem. Vincent claims that human choices, not algorithms, determine the outcome (Vincent). A meeting feels shallow only when leaders prioritize speed over care. A classroom loses depth when teachers avoid meaningful discussion. In this view, technology reflects values rather than erasing them. Still, design matters. If systems make it easy to replace human contact, most users will take that easier path.</p>
            <p>Finding balance, therefore, becomes essential. We should use AI to enhance, not replace, human insight. Clear boundaries help. Allow AI to summarize information or automate small tasks, but reserve human input for ethical or emotional decisions. Label assisted content so readers understand its origin. This transparency maintains trust and accountability.</p>
            <p>Moreover, protecting privacy must remain a priority. Limit data collection, secure storage, and audit models for fairness. The OECD urges transparency and human oversight as key safeguards (OECD). Rules like these sustain innovation by keeping it rooted in respect for people.</p>
            <p>Equally important is preserving skill and empathy. Teams should hold real discussions for conflict, mentoring, and problem-solving. Students should practice independent writing before seeking digital help. These habits strengthen understanding and maintain the emotional intelligence that technology cannot replace.</p>
            <p>Education offers the clearest path forward. Teachers can integrate AI responsibly by setting guidelines: allow brainstorming support but require original drafts. Encourage students to reflect on how they use AI and what they learn from it. Such practices teach accountability and ethical awareness alongside technical skill.</p>
            <p>Public institutions must also adopt these principles. Use AI to improve safety, efficiency, and access, but keep humans accountable for moral and social decisions. Publish transparent model reports and invite public feedback. Treat citizens as partners rather than data points. Doing so builds trust and shared responsibility.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the goal is thoughtful balance. AI can extend human capacity and help solve global problems, yet it can also distance us from each other if used carelessly. The solution is not avoidance but awareness. By setting limits, protecting privacy, and valuing human judgment, we can ensure that AI strengthens rather than replaces our social bonds.</p>

          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p>This blog was created for ENC 1102 with Professor Dale Mahfood. It fulfills the requirement for a major researched argument that combines multiple credible sources into one sustained claim.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Writing this project taught me how to connect evidence, purpose, and audience into one sustained argument. At first, I saw research writing as formal and distant, but ENC 1102 helped me see it as a process of choice and clarity. I had to decide what claim mattered, why readers should care, and how sources could guide reasoning without taking control of it. My goal was to balance analysis and simplicity so that the essay could read like a conversation about real consequences. Revision played the biggest role in growth. Early drafts felt mechanical. Later ones focused more on cause and effect, tone, and smooth transitions. I also learned to cut vague language and choose verbs that show intent. Citing sources correctly built credibility and rhythm. More than anything, I learned to treat writing as an act of thinking out loud, where each paragraph tests an idea against evidence. This reflection represents how ENC 1102 changed my understanding of writing from a grade-driven task to a form of inquiry and expression. It is about learning to write with both discipline and curiosity, which are the same skills that make responsible research possible.</p>
