            <h2>How reliance on AI shapes human connection (Draft 1)</h2>
            <div class="meta">By Brennan Shea. November 3, 2025.</div>
            <p>I use artificial intelligence every day. It helps me draft emails, plan tasks, and find patterns in data. These tools feel natural now. Yet as their use expands, I often wonder how this growing reliance changes the way people relate to one another. Artificial intelligence can lift productivity and widen access, but unchecked dependence may weaken real human connection. The goal is not to reject AI but to manage its place responsibly in modern life.</p>
            <p>To understand the appeal of AI, it helps to look at its practical benefits. Many users rely on AI to complete repetitive tasks quickly and accurately. It drafts notes, summarizes information, and corrects grammar errors, saving people both time and frustration. Lawson highlights these effects, noting how AI enhances communication and creativity for everyday users (Lawson). From my experience, using AI to organize schedules and generate drafts frees mental space for deeper thought and more meaningful conversation. This efficiency represents one of the technology’s greatest strengths.</p>
            <p>These personal advantages also extend to public good. In Southeast Asia, machine learning has improved weather prediction, forest monitoring, and waste management. Board documents these examples, showing that while infrastructure limits remain, the results prove promising (Board). Projects like these demonstrate how AI can serve as a global tool for safety, sustainability, and innovation. When systems prevent harm or protect natural resources, they validate their role as an ally to human progress.</p>
            <p>However, these benefits are paired with serious ethical concerns. The European Parliamentary Research Service warns that unregulated AI use increases surveillance, bias, and privacy loss. As organizations automate decision-making, small biases can scale into widespread inequality. People who feel monitored may avoid open dialogue or creativity (European Parliamentary Research Service). In this way, technology that should empower users can instead suppress trust. Without oversight, the systems meant to connect us could divide us further.</p>
            <p>Beyond issues of privacy, dependence on AI can erode critical thinking. Students who turn to chatbots for quick answers lose practice in analysis. Professionals who use digital assistants to write feedback risk losing empathy. Russell and Norvig explain that intelligent reasoning depends heavily on context, something machines still struggle to grasp (Russell and Norvig). When people outsource judgment to AI, they slowly lose the very skills that make human decision-making valuable.</p>
            <p>Some experts argue this erosion extends to information itself. Bender and colleagues describe the “stochastic parrots” problem, where language models generate fluent but unreliable text (Bender et al.). While these systems mimic understanding, they often reproduce existing biases or errors. The result is polished writing without accuracy. When audiences cannot tell truth from imitation, civic understanding weakens. This confusion threatens democracy as much as individual learning.</p>
            <p>Social scientists also warn that AI can widen emotional distance. Turkle observes that people increasingly substitute digital conversation for genuine connection (Turkle). AI could accelerate this by managing emotional exchanges on our behalf. For example, users can ask a chatbot to write apologies, compliments, or condolences. The words may be polite, but they lack the personal vulnerability that builds trust. Over time, emotional outsourcing could dull empathy and make real relationships harder to maintain.</p>
            <p>Still, some believe that technology itself is not to blame. Vincent argues that human priorities shape AI outcomes, not the algorithms alone (Vincent). A meeting becomes shallow only when leaders value speed over care. A class discussion loses meaning only when students choose convenience over curiosity. This argument reminds us that design and use are inseparable. Developers and users share equal responsibility for ensuring that tools serve human well-being.</p>
            <p>Balancing these views requires intention. People should use AI to enhance, not replace, human insight. Boundaries help preserve integrity. AI can summarize reports or automate data collection, but moral and creative choices should remain human. Clear labeling of AI-assisted content also protects transparency and accountability. When users know how information is produced, they can engage with it responsibly.</p>
            <p>Protecting privacy is equally crucial. The OECD emphasizes transparency and human oversight as essential safeguards (OECD). Governments and corporations must restrict unnecessary data collection and enforce fairness audits for algorithms. Responsible regulation does not limit progress; it ensures that innovation remains ethical and sustainable. These standards keep AI grounded in respect for human dignity.</p>
            <p>Just as systems need oversight, people need practice. Teams should reserve time for live problem-solving, debate, and mentorship. Students should write first drafts without AI before using it for revision. These steps preserve creativity and empathy. In both workplaces and classrooms, collaboration grows stronger when people rely on dialogue, not automation, to solve problems.</p>
            <p>Education shows how balance can succeed. Teachers can integrate AI as a brainstorming aid while reinforcing original thought. Asking students to explain how AI shaped their work builds accountability and reflection. These habits teach digital ethics and reinforce the value of authenticity in writing and discussion. When guided carefully, AI becomes a tool for growth, not avoidance.</p>
            <p>Public institutions face similar challenges. They can apply AI to improve public safety, manage infrastructure, and expand access to information. Yet human oversight must remain central. Publishing clear reports about how AI systems operate and inviting citizen feedback promote transparency. Treating the public as collaborators rather than subjects builds civic trust and ensures that innovation aligns with shared values.</p>
            <p>In the end, the question is not whether AI helps or harms but how humans choose to use it. Artificial intelligence magnifies both our strengths and our weaknesses. It can expand knowledge, streamline systems, and improve lives. It can also reduce empathy, spread bias, and dull creativity if left unchecked. The future depends on our willingness to slow down, reflect, and stay accountable. By pairing efficiency with ethics, and curiosity with care, we can ensure that AI supports—not replaces—the human connection that defines us.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>Writing this project taught me how to connect evidence, purpose, and audience into one sustained argument. At first, I saw research writing as formal and distant, but ENC 1102 helped me see it as a process of choice and clarity. I had to decide what claim mattered, why readers should care, and how sources could guide reasoning without taking control of it. My goal was to balance analysis and simplicity so that the essay could read like a conversation about real consequences. Revision played the biggest role in growth. Early drafts felt mechanical. Later ones focused more on cause and effect, tone, and smooth transitions. I also learned to cut vague language and choose verbs that show intent. Citing sources correctly built credibility and rhythm. More than anything, I learned to treat writing as an act of thinking out loud, where each paragraph tests an idea against evidence. This reflection represents how ENC 1102 changed my understanding of writing from a grade-driven task to a form of inquiry and expression. It is about learning to write with both discipline and curiosity, which are the same skills that make responsible research possible.</p>
